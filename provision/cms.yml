  ## CMS dirs
  # Neither Vagrantfiles, nor Ansible playbooks are able to resolve variables
  # within YAML files, so something like the following:
  # ---
  #   USER_HOME: "/home/${CMS_USER}"
  #   BASEDIR: "${CMS_USER_HOME}/cms"
  # ---
  # would work in the install script when the YAML file is read by the shell,
  # but it should not be relied upon.
