ssh keys
--------
The files `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` contained in this folder are respectively the private and public SSH keys used during the installation of CMS.

The private key `id_rsa` has no passphrase.

If you use these scripts to install CMS outside of a test environment you should change them with a passphrase-protected keypair.
